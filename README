ponymap
=======

`ponymap' is an experimental network scanner, not even in the alpha stage yet.

The ultimate purpose of this scanner is bruteforcing hosts and ports in search
of running services.  Replacing nmap is not the goal.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: openssl, clang, pkg-config, GNU make, awk, sh

If you don't have Clang, you can edit the Makefile to use GCC or TCC, they work
just as good.  But there's no CMake support yet, so I force it in the Makefile.

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/ponymap.git
 $ make

That is all, no installation is required, or supported for that matter.

First you might want to generate a configuration file:
 $ ./ponymap --write-default-config

After making any necessary edits to the file (there are comments to aid you in
doing that), simply run the appropriate program with no arguments to retrieve
a usage text.
