ponymap
=======

`ponymap' is an experimental network scanner, of alpha quality so far.

Replacing nmap is not the goal, even though it would be rather very nice to
have a serious network scanner with a permissive license.

The ultimate purpose of this scanner is bruteforcing hosts and ports in search
of running services of a kind.  It should be simple and straight-forward to
either write your own service detection plugins, provided that you're familiar
with writing asynchronous code, or to make changes to the existing ones.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: openssl, clang, pkg-config, GNU make, help2man, Jansson

If you don't have Clang, you can edit the Makefile to use GCC or TCC, they work
just as good.  But there's no CMake support yet, so I force it in the Makefile.

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/ponymap.git
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ make

That is all, no installation is required, or supported for that matter.

First you might want to generate a configuration file:
 $ ./ponymap --write-default-config

After making any necessary edits to the file (there are comments to aid you in
doing that), simply run the appropriate program with no arguments to retrieve
a usage text.
