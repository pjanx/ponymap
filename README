ponymap
=======

`ponymap' is an experimental network scanner, of alpha quality so far.

Replacing nmap is not the goal, even though it would be rather very nice to
have a serious network scanner with a permissive license.

The ultimate purpose of this scanner is bruteforcing hosts and ports in search
of running services of a kind.  It should be simple and straight-forward to
either write your own service detection plugins, provided that you're familiar
with writing asynchronous code, or to make changes to the existing ones.

So far there are some problems with reliability, and some clever algorithm to
avoid overloading the network is needed.  Until then, you can use ulimit to cap
the maximum number of concurrent connections.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: GCC/Clang, GNU make, help2man, pkg-config, openssl, Jansson

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/ponymap.git
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ make

That is all, no installation is required, or supported for that matter.

First you might want to generate a configuration file:
 $ ./ponymap --write-default-config

After making any necessary edits to the file (there are comments to aid you in
doing that), simply run the appropriate program with no arguments to retrieve
a usage text.

Author's Notes
--------------
This was quite an interesting project to write and it has taught me a lot about
event loops.  It would be relatively simple to plug in libuv if more robustness
and portability is needed, though.
