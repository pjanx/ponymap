ponymap
=======

`ponymap' is an experimental network scanner, of alpha quality so far.

Replacing nmap is not the goal, even though it would be rather very nice to
have a serious network scanner with a permissive license.

The ultimate purpose of this scanner is bruteforcing hosts and ports in search
of running services of a kind.  It should be simple and straight-forward to
either write your own service detection plugins, provided that you're familiar
with writing asynchronous code, or to make changes to the existing ones.

So far there are some problems with reliability, and some clever algorithm to
avoid overloading the network is needed.  Until then, you can use ulimit to cap
the maximum number of concurrent connections.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, help2man
Runtime dependenices: curses, openssl, Jansson, lua = 5.3 (optional)

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/ponymap.git
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_LUA=NO
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:
 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:
 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i ponymap-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix cpack with
`fakeroot' or file ownership will end up wrong.

Having the program installed, simply run it with no arguments to retrieve
a usage text.  Have fun scanning.

Author's Notes
--------------
This was quite an interesting project to write and it has taught me a lot about
event loops.  It would be relatively simple to plug in libuv if more robustness
and portability is needed, though.
